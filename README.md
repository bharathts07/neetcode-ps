# [Neetcode Solutions](https://github.com/bharathts07/neetcode-ps)

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) curated list of coding interview questions. I will be solving these problems primarily in Python.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is stored in its own subfolder under the `Problem` directory. Each subfolder contains a Markdown file with the problem description, my thoughts, and the solution in Python or another language of choice.
