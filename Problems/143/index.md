# [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![e1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [1,4,2,3]

**Example 2:**

![e2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [1,5,2,4,3]

## **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return

        # Find the middle of the list
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Reverse the second half of the list
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            nxt = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nxt

        # Merge the two halves
        first, second = head, prev
        while second.next:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2

        return head

```


## Thoughts

Initially thought it would be a recursive solution and was stumped, but got help to find the middly of the list , reverse the later half and combine the two list to get the result.

Time complecity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1)
